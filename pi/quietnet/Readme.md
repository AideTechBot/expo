# Quietnet

Simple chat program using near ultrasonic frequencies. Works without Wifi or Bluetooth and won't show up in a pcap.

Note: If you can clearly hear the send script working then your speakers may not be high quality enough to produce sounds in the near ultrasonic range.

## Usage

run `python send.py` in one terminal window and `python listen.py` in another. Text you input into the send.py window should appear (after a delay) in the listen.py window.

**Warning:** May annoy some animals and humans.
